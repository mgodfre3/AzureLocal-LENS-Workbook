Azure Local Lifecycle, Events & Notification Status (LENS) workbook brings together the signals you need to understand your Azure Local estate through a fleet lens. Instead of jumping between individual resources, you can use a consistent set of views to compare instances, spot outliers, and drill into the focus areas that need attention. LENS workbook provides comprehensive visibility into cluster health, update readiness, and workload status across your entire Azure Local fleet.

**Important:** This is a community-driven / open-source project, (not officially supported by Microsoft), for any issues, requests or feedback, please [raise an Issue](https://aka.ms/AzureLocalLENS/issues) (note: no time scales or guarantees can be provided for responses to issues.)

## Recent Changes (v0.8.3)

- **Azure Monitor Workspace Parameter**: New dropdown to select the Azure Monitor Workspace collecting Prometheus metrics from AKS Arc clusters
- **Prometheus Time Range**: Dedicated time range picker (30 min to 7 days, default 4 hours) for Prometheus metric charts

### Bug Fixes & Technical Improvements
- **ARG Query Fixes**: Removed all `let` statements from `extensibilityresources` queries (ARG constraint), restructured queries to work within single-extensibilityresources-per-query limit
- **VM/AKS Resource Discovery**: Replaced RG-based joins with proper `extendedLocation` → `customlocations` → `arcBridgeRG` chain for correct multi-cluster environments
- **Container Insights**: Fixed case-sensitive `extract` bug and added `InsightsMetrics` union for modern AMA/DCR support
- **Network Throughput**: Fixed query to include both `ObjectName` values and both traffic directions; added `materialize()` optimization
- **VM Perf Query**: Removed incorrect RG filter, added Linux and InsightsMetrics support
- **Disconnected Cluster Fallbacks**: Arc machine fallback for blank pCPUs/memory, OS Edition derived from build number, `logicalCores/2` for physical core estimation

- 🔄 Azure Local Update Guide

## Parameters

The workbook provides several filtering options to help you focus on specific resources:

### Scope Filters
- **Subscriptions**: Filter data by one or more Azure subscriptions (defaults to all accessible subscriptions)

### Resource Group Filter
- **Resource Group Filter**: Optional wildcard filter for resource group names
  - Use `*` as a wildcard character to match any sequence of characters
  - Examples:
    - `*-prod-*` matches resource groups containing "-prod-" (e.g., "rg-hci-prod-01", "azure-prod-cluster")
    - `*hci*` matches any resource group containing "hci"
    - `rg-*` matches resource groups starting with "rg-"
  - Leave empty to show all resource groups

### Cluster Tag Filter
- **Cluster Tag Name**: The name of the tag to filter by (e.g., "Environment", "Team", "CostCenter")
- **Cluster Tag Value**: The value of the tag to match (e.g., "Production", "IT-Ops")
- **Note**: Tag filtering applies **only to Azure Local clusters** - it does not filter AKS Arc clusters or Azure Local VMs
- Both Tag Name and Tag Value must be provided for the filter to take effect

### Time Range
- **Time Range**: Select the time range for time-based queries (1 day to 30 days, or custom)

## Usage Tips

- Use the subscription filter to focus on specific environments (e.g., production vs. development)
- Regularly check the System Health tab before scheduling maintenance windows
- Monitor the ARB Status tab to ensure Azure Arc connectivity is healthy
- Export data to Excel using the export button on grids for reporting purposes
- Set up Azure Monitor alerts based on the queries in this workbook for proactive monitoring

## Azure Resource Graph | Azure Local Resource Joins | Useful Information

Understanding how Azure Local resources are linked across Azure Resource Graph (ARG) is essential for building accurate queries. The workbook uses the following join chains to associate workload resources with their parent HCI cluster:

- **Azure Local VMs:** `machine.id` → `microsoft.azurestackhci/virtualmachineinstances` (extensibility, joined by extracting machineId before `/providers/Microsoft.AzureStackHCI`) → `extendedLocation.name` → custom location → `arcBridgeRG` → HCI cluster

- **AKS Arc Clusters:** `connectedcluster.id` → `microsoft.hybridcontainerservice/provisionedclusterinstances` (extensibility, joined by extracting aksId before `/providers/Microsoft.HybridContainerService`) → `extendedLocation.name` → custom location → `arcBridgeRG` → HCI cluster

- **Storage Volumes:** `microsoft.azurestackhci/storagecontainers` (joined by `extendedLocation.name`) → custom location (joined by extracting `arcBridgeRG` from `hostResourceId`) → HCI cluster (joined by `resourceGroup`)

> **Key concept:** The Arc Resource Bridge appliance and the HCI cluster are always deployed in the same resource group (`arcBridgeRG`). Custom locations reference the Arc Bridge via `properties.hostResourceId`, and the bridge's resource group is extracted with `split(hostResourceId, '/')[4]`. This resource group is then used to join to the HCI cluster.

## Appendix: Previous Version Changes

### v0.8.2

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed VMs appearing in Azure Local Machines section** ([#31](https://github.com/Azure/AzureLocal-LENS-Workbook/issues/31)): Arc-enabled VMs running on Azure Local were incorrectly displayed as physical nodes in the Azure Local Machines tab and the Overview dashboard tile. Added `kind != "HCI"` filter to all 21 affected KQL queries to exclude VMs (which have `kind == "HCI"`) while retaining only physical server nodes (which have an empty `kind` field). This fix affects the Total Machines tile, Connected/Disconnected/Expired/Error tiles, OS distribution and license type charts, the All Azure Local Machines table, the Extensions table, the Failed Extensions detail view, the NIC health views, and the Updates health summary.

### v0.8.1

#### New Features
- **Azure Hybrid Benefit Column**: Added Azure Hybrid Benefit (Software Assurance) status column to the All Clusters table on the Azure Local Instances tab, sourced from `properties.softwareAssuranceProperties.softwareAssuranceStatus`
- **Windows Server Subscription Column**: Added Windows Server Subscription status column to the All Clusters table, sourced from `properties.desiredProperties.windowsServerSubscription`
- **Azure Verification for VMs Column**: Added Azure Verification for VMs (IMDS Attestation) status column to the All Clusters table, sourced from `properties.reportedProperties.imdsAttestation`
- **Licensing & Verification Pie Charts**: Added new "Azure Licensing & Verification" section with three pie charts showing Enabled/Disabled distribution across clusters for Azure Hybrid Benefit, Windows Server Subscription, and Azure Verification for VMs

### v0.8.0

#### Bug Fixes
- **Update Attempts by Day Chart Date Ordering** ([Issue #24](https://github.com/Azure/AzureLocal-LENS-Workbook/issues/24)): Fixed the "Update Attempts by Day" bar chart on the Update Progress tab not displaying dates in chronological order. The root cause was the chart's `group by state` rendering, which processed each state series (Succeeded, Failed, InProgress) independently — each series contributed its own dates to the x-axis in isolation, producing interleaved non-chronological ordering. Fixed by pivoting the KQL query to produce one row per time bucket with `Succeeded`, `Failed`, and `InProgress` as separate columns using `countif()`, eliminating the per-series grouping and guaranteeing a single chronologically ordered row sequence.

- **Update Run History Excludes Resolved and Active Failures**: Improved the "Update Run History and Error Details" table to automatically exclude failed update runs when a Succeeded or InProgress run exists for the same cluster and Update Name. Additionally, when multiple failed runs exist for the same cluster and update, only the latest failure (by last updated time) is shown, reducing noise and focusing troubleshooting on the most recent issue.

- **Clusters Currently Updating Excludes Stale InProgress Runs**: The "Clusters Currently Updating" table now excludes InProgress update runs when a Succeeded run already exists for the same cluster and Update Name, preventing stale entries from appearing.

- **Clusters Currently Updating View Progress Link**: Fixed the "View Progress" link in the "Clusters Currently Updating" table which was not displaying update step data in the Azure portal. The link now uses the correct portal URL format with `updateName~/null` instead of passing the specific update name.

- **Deployment Chart Sub-Month Time Ranges**: Fixed the "1 week" and "2 weeks" time range options on both deployment charts returning no data. The fractional month parameter values (0.25, 0.5) were being truncated to zero by integer conversion.

#### New Features
- **Current Step in Clusters Currently Updating**: Added a "Current Step" column to the "Clusters Currently Updating" table showing the deepest currently-executing step from the update run's progress hierarchy. This is extracted by walking the nested steps structure (up to 9 levels deep) to find the most specific `InProgress` step, falling back to the top-level progress description when deeper step data is unavailable.
- **Step Duration in Clusters Currently Updating**: Added a "Step Duration" column showing how long the cluster has been on its current update step (e.g., "2h 15m", "1d 3h 42m"). Calculated from the step's `startTimeUtc` against the current time.

#### Improvements
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Added GitHub Actions workflow for automated unit testing of workbook JSON structure, KQL query validation, and version consistency checks with NUnit XML test result output

- **Continuous Timeline on Update Attempts by Day Chart**: The bar chart now fills date gaps with zero-count entries using a date scaffold, ensuring a continuous timeline with no missing days/weeks/months even when there is no update activity.

- **Dynamic Time Granularity on Deployment Line Charts**: Both the "Azure Local Clusters Deployment Over Time" and "AKS Arc Cluster Deployments Over Time" line charts now use daily data points for time ranges of 1 month or less, weekly data points for up to 3 months, and monthly data points for longer ranges.

- **Default Time Range Changed to 45 Days**: The global time range filter now defaults to 45 days (previously 7 days), giving broader visibility into update history and deployment trends out of the box. Added 45-day and 60-day options to the time range picker.

### v0.7.9

#### New Features
- **Dependency Information Column with SBE Details** ([Issue #20](https://github.com/Azure/AzureLocal-LENS-Workbook/issues/20)) (Update Progress tab): Added a new **Dependency Information** column to the "📦 Clusters with Updates Available" table:
  - Shows SBE version with ⚠️ warning icon as a clickable link only when the update state is **AdditionalContentRequired** or **HasPrerequisite**
  - Clicking the link opens a flyout showing Solution Builder Extension (SBE) details:
    - **Publisher**: The OEM/hardware vendor name
    - **Family**: The SBE family identifier
    - **Version**: The SBE version that will be installed
    - **Release Notes**: Link to SBE release documentation
  - This helps identify when OEM-specific content needs to be downloaded before an update can proceed

- **Update Status Column with Emoji Icons** (System Health tab): Added visual emoji icons to the "Update Status" column in both the "System Health Checks Overview" and "Update Readiness Summary" tables:
  - 🔄 Updates available
  - ⚠️ Needs attention
  - ✅ Up to date / Applied successfully
  - ⏳ Update in progress / Preparation in progress
  - ❌ Update failed / Preparation failed

- **Tip for Update Progress Tab** (System Health tab): Added a tip below the "System Health Checks Overview" table recommending users review the "📦 Clusters with Updates Available" table in the Update Progress tab for more details

#### Improvements
- **Renamed "Update Readiness" tab to "System Health"**: The tab has been renamed to better reflect its purpose of showing overall cluster system health status, not just update readiness
- **Renamed "State" to "Update Status"** (System Health tab): The "State" column in the "System Health Checks Overview" table has been renamed to "Update Status" for clarity and consistency with the "Update Readiness Summary" table
- **Renamed "SBE Version" to "Current SBE Version"** (Update Progress tab): The "SBE Version" column in the "📦 Clusters with Updates Available" table has been renamed to "Current SBE Version" for clarity, and moved to appear after "Current Version"
- **Removed Update Dependency Column** (System Health tab): The "Update Dependency" column has been removed from the "System Health Checks Overview" table as this information is now shown in the "📦 Clusters with Updates Available" table in the Update Progress tab
- **Column Order Update** (Update Progress tab): In the "📦 Clusters with Updates Available" table, "Update State" now appears before "Dependency Information"

### v0.7.81

#### New Features

- **Clickable Count Columns** ([Issue #16](https://github.com/Azure/AzureLocal-LENS-Workbook/issues/16)) (Azure Local Instances tab):
  - **Nodes** column now links to the cluster's Machines page in Azure Portal
  - **VMs** column now links to the cluster's Virtual Machines page in Azure Portal
  - **AKS Arc** column now links to the cluster's Kubernetes Clusters page in Azure Portal

- **VM Count and AKS Arc Count Columns Relocated** ([Issue #16](https://github.com/Azure/AzureLocal-LENS-Workbook/issues/16)) (Azure Local Instances tab):
  - Moved **VMs** and **AKS Arc** columns from "System Health Checks Overview" table (System Health tab) to the "📊 All Azure Local Clusters" table
  - Counts now use proper relationship chain through Custom Location and Arc Resource Bridge for improved accuracy when resources are in different resource groups

- **Update Filters** ([Issue #15](https://github.com/Azure/AzureLocal-LENS-Workbook/issues/15)):
  - Added **Filter by Update Available** multi-select dropdown to "📦 Clusters with Updates Available" table (Update Progress tab) - filters clusters by specific available update versions

#### Improvements

- **Increased Table Row Limits**: All tables now support up to 2,000 rows (previously 250) to prevent "Results were limited to the first 250 rows" warnings
- **Column Label Improvements** (Azure Local Instances tab):
  - Renamed "Node Count" to "Nodes"
  - Renamed "VM Count" to "VMs"
